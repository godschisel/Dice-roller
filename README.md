# Dice-roller

This is simple Dice roller simulator for DnD. 
Fun little project to test out Tkinter.

## To do:
- *combine multiple dice types in one roll*
- add result copy-paste 
- show rolling history
- show statistics of means, best and worst rolls
- GUI modification 
	- red for nat1, green for nat20 (etc)
	- average roll normal font, extreme roll bolder
- smarter error handling - would be cool to show what is wrong
